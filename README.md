# Source Code

Python coding challenges (tests) for the Science Olympiad event Source Code.

Programming tests will be found at com/prestonsproductions/sourcecode

These tests have been uploaded to help Science Olympiad teams (and others) practice programming. Tests contain a variety of questions with increasing difficulty that relate to a similar theme/topic. 

An uncompleted and completed python file (with answers) are included for each test. A Main python file is also included, but can be disregarded. Note that in the Source Code event, supervisors will change data from the main function. If code and algorithms are written correctly, the questions/functions will still produce the correct results with the provided data.
